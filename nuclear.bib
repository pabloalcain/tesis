	abstract = {Nuclear shapes in the inner crust of a neutron star are studied with due consideration for nuclear surface diffuseness and lattice types. The nuclear shapes considered are cylinder, slab and cylindrical hole in addition to sphere and spherical hole. The Thomas-Fermi calculations are performed in the zero-temperature approximation with four energy density functionals. These functionals are constructed so as to reproduce gross properties of laboratory nuclei and to be consistent with the equation of state of pure neutron matter by Friedman and Pandharipande. The nucleon distributions are parametrized in a way that allows a neutron gas outside the nuclei as well as different nuclear surfaces for neutrons and protons. This study confirms the liquid-drop result that the nuclear shape changes from sphere to cylinder, slab, cylindrical hole and spherical hole successively as the matter density increases. These shape changes occur at densities between 1.0 × 1014 and 1.5 × 1014 g/cm3, and are accompanied by first-order phase transitions. The density range for each nuclear shape to exist stably becomes narrower successively in the above order. At a fixed matter density, the energy difference between the phases of two successive nuclear shapes is of the order of 0.1–1 keV per nucleon. The existence of non-spherical nuclear shapes reduces the energy by an amount up to 3–5 keV per nucleon compared with the case in which only spherical and spherical hole nuclei are considered. This energy reduction corresponds to 4–6 MeV per spherical nucleus.},

	abstract = {Ideal nuclear matter is expected to undergo a first order phase transition at the thermodynamic limit. At such phase transitions the size of density fluctuations (bubbles or droplets) scale with the size of the system. This means that simulations of nuclear matter at sub-saturation densities will inexorably suffer from what is vaguely referred to as “finite size effects”. It is usually thought that these finite size effects can be diminished by imposing periodic boundary conditions and making the system large enough, but as we show in this work, that is actually not the case at sub-saturation densities. In this paper we analyze the equilibrium configurations of molecular dynamics simulations of a classical model for symmetric ideal (uncharged) nuclear matter at sub-saturation densities and low temperatures, where phase coexistence is expected at the thermodynamic limit. We show that the most stable configurations in this density range are almost completely determined by artificial aspects of the simulations (i.e. boundary conditions) and can be predicted analytically by surface minimization. This result is very general and is shown to hold true for several well known semi-classical models of nuclear interaction and even for a simple Lennard-Jones potential. Also, in the limit of very large systems, when “small size” effects can be neglected, those equilibrium configurations seem to be restricted to a few structures reminiscent to the “Pasta Phases” expected in Neutron Star matter, but arising from a completely different origin: In Neutron Star matter, the non-homogeneous structures arise from a competition between nuclear and Coulomb interactions while for ideal nuclear matter they emerge from finite (yet not “small”) size effects. The role of periodic boundary conditions and finite size effects in Neutron Star matter simulations are reexamined.},

In particular, in the implemented version II of the constrained molecular dynamics model the problem related to the non-conservation of the total angular momentum has been solved. This problem affects other semi-classical microscopic approaches due to the “hard core” repulsive interaction and, more generally, to the usage of random forces.

The large Au+Au system displays, in the simulations as in the experiment, simultaneously dynamical and statistical behavior, which we analyze in detail.

Such periodic surfaces appear in all systems which are characterized by internal interfaces and which additionally exhibit ordering. One example are systems of AB diblock copolymers, where the internal interfaces are formed by the chemical bonds between the A and B blocks. In these systems at least two bicontinuous phases are formed: the ordered bicontinuous double diamond phase and the gyroid phase. In these phases the ordered domains of A monomers and B monomers are separated by a periodic interface of the same symmetry as the phases themselves. Here we present a novel method for the generation of such periodic surfaces based on the simple Landau-Ginzburg model of microemulsions. We test the method on four known minimal periodic surfaces, find two new surfaces of cubic symmetry, and show how to obtain periodic surfaces of high genus and n-tuply continuous phases (n {\textgreater} 2). So far only bicontinuous (n = 2) phases have been known. We point out that the Landau model used here should be generic for all systems characterized by internal interfaces, including the diblock copolymer systems.},

In this Letter, we discuss other possible structures, that is, gyroid and double-diamond morphologies, which are periodic bicontinuous structures discovered in a block copolymer. Utilizing the compressible liquid drop model, we show that there is a chance of gyroid appearance near the transition point from a cylinder to a slab and the volume fraction at this point is also similar for nuclear and polymer systems. Although the five shapes listed initially have been long thought to be the only major constituents of so-called nuclear pasta at subnuclear densities, our findings imply that this belief needs to be reconsidered.},

Under special conditions, however, negative temperatures - where high-energy states are more occupied than low-energy states - are also possible. So far, such states have been demonstrated in localized systems with finite, discrete spectra. Here, we were able to prepare a negative temperature state for motional degrees of freedom. By tailoring the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian we created an attractively interacting ensemble of ultracold bosons at negative temperature that is stable against collapse for arbitrary atom numbers. The quasi-momentum distribution develops sharp peaks at the upper band edge, revealing thermal equilibrium and bosonic coherence over several lattice sites. Negative temperatures imply negative pressures and open up new parameter regimes for cold atoms, enabling fundamentally new many-body states and counterintuitive effects such as Carnot engines above unity efficiency.},

Often, however, the states to which the system will evolve are not known in advance. We present a new, TST-based method for extending the MD time scale that does not require advanced knowledge of the states of the system or the transition states that separate them. The potential is augmented by a bias potential, designed to raise the energy in regions other than at the dividing surfaces. State to state evolution on the biased potential occurs in the proper sequence, but at an accelerated rate with a nonlinear time scale. Time is no longer an independent variable, but becomes a statistically estimated property that converges to the exact result at long times. The long-time dynamical behavior is exact if there are no TST-violating correlated dynamical events, and appears to be a good approximation even when this condition is not met. We show that for strongly coupled (i.e., solid state) systems, appropriate bias potentials can be constructed from properties of the Hessian matrix. This new “hyper-MD” method is demonstrated on two model potentials and for the diffusion of a Ni atom on a Ni(100) terrace for a duration of 20 μs.},

(Paris) 320, 135 (2005)] statistical treatment of finite unbound systems in the presence of collective motions is applied to a classical Lennard-Jones system, numerically simulated through molecular dynamics. In the ideal gas limit, the flow dynamics can be exactly recast into effective time-dependent Lagrange parameters acting on a standard Gibbs ensemble with an extra total energy conservation constraint. Using this same ansatz for the low-density freeze-out configurations of an interacting expanding system, we show that the presence of flow can have a sizable effect on the microstate distribution.},

Explicit expressions for thermodynamic functions are derived both for "symmetric transitions" (such as the jump of the spontaneous magnetization in the Ising model from +Msp to −Msp as the field changes from 0+ to 0−) as well as for asymmetric cases, but restricting attention to (hyper)cubic system shapes. As an explicit example for the usefulness of these considerations in Monte Carlo simulations where it may be a problem to (i) locate a phase transition and (ii) distinguish first-order from second-order transitions, we present numerical results for the two-dimensional nearest-neighbor Ising ferromagnet in a field, both below the critical temperature Tc and at Tc. The numerical results are found to be in very good agreement with the phenomenological theory and it is shown that one may extract the magnitudes of jumps occurring at first-order phase transitions in a well-defined and accurate way.},

	abstract = {Computer simulations are employed to obtain subcritical isotherms of small finite sized systems inside the coexistence region. For all temperatures considered, ranging from the triple point up to the critical point, the isotherms gradually developed a sequence of sharp discontinuities as the system size increased from ∼ 8 to ∼ 21 molecular diameters. For the smallest system sizes, and more so close to the critical point, the isotherms appeared smooth, resembling the continuous van der Waals loop obtained from extrapolation of an analytic equation of state outside the coexistence region. As the system size was increased, isotherms in the chemical potential-density plane developed first two, then four, and finally six discontinuities. Visual inspection of selected snapshots revealed that the observed discontinuities are related to structural transitions between droplets (on the vapor side) and bubbles (on the liquid side) of spherical, cylindrical, and tetragonal shapes. A capillary drop model was developed to qualitatively rationalize these observations. Analytic results were obtained and found to be in full agreement with the computer simulation results. The analysis shows that the shape of the subcritical isotherms is dictated by a single characteristic volume (or length scale), which depends on the surface tension, compressibility, and coexistence densities. For small reduced system volumes, the model predicts that a homogeneous fluid is stable across the whole coexistence region, thus explaining the continuous van der Waals isotherms observed in the simulations. When the liquid and vapor free energies are described by means of an accurate mean-fieldequation of state and surface tensions from simulation are employed, the capillary model is found to describe the simulated isotherms accurately, especially for large systems (i.e., larger than about 15 molecular diameters) at low temperature (lower than about 0.85 times the critical temperature). This implies that the Laplace pressure differences can be predicted for drops as small as five molecular diameters, and as few as about 500 molecules . The theoretical study also shows that the extrema or apparent spinodal points of the finite size loops are more closely related to (finite system size) bubble and dew points than to classical spinodals. Our results are of relevance to phase transitions in nanopores and show that first order corrections to nucleation energies in finite closed systems are power laws of the inverse volume.},

Two essential points contribute to this generality: (a) Exact expressions independent of statistics and degeneration can be given for the coordinate and time derivatives of the coefficient A of the equilibrium distribution function in terms of the pressure and temperature gradients and time derivatives, though a closed expression for this coefficient as a function of v and T is known only in limiting cases; (b) The function W of the general equation of state for ideal gases in all statistics pv=(RTM)W(v23T) is adiabatically invariant. Numerical values of the viscosity and heat conductivity coefficients, which should come out of the formal theory on the introduction of special assumptions about the molecular forces, have not yet been obtained.

The neutron star gravitational mass limit obtained with this interaction is 1.67M⊙. Boost corrections to the two-nucleon interaction, which give the leading relativistic effect of order (v/c)2, as well as three-nucleon interactions, are also included in the nuclear Hamiltonian. Their successive addition increases the mass limit to 1.80 and 2.20 M⊙. Hamiltonians including a three-nucleon interaction predict a transition in neutron star matter to a phase with neutral pion condensation at a baryon number density of ∼0.2 fm-3. Neutron stars predicted by these Hamiltonians have a layer with a thickness on the order of tens of meters, over which the density changes rapidly from that of the normal to the condensed phase. The material in this thin layer is a mixture of the two phases. We also investigate the possibility of dense nucleon matter having an admixture of quark matter, described using the bag model equation of state. Neutron stars of 1.4M⊙ do not appear to have quark matter admixtures in their cores. However, the heaviest stars are predicted to have cores consisting of a quark and nucleon matter mixture. These admixtures reduce the maximum mass of neutron stars from 2.20 to 2.02 (1.91) M⊙ for bag constant B=200 (122) MeV/fm3. Stars with pure quark matter in their cores are found to be unstable. We also consider the possibility that matter is maximally incompressible above an assumed density, and show that realistic models of nuclear forces limit the maximum mass of neutron stars to be below 2.5M⊙. The effects of the phase transitions on the composition of neutron star matter and its adiabatic index Γ are discussed.},

High-energy nuclear collisions between finite nuclei which lead to matter fragmentation are used to investigate these properties. The present report covers effective work done on the subject over the two last decades. The analysis of experimental data is confronted with two major problems, the setting up of thermodynamic equilibrium in a time-dependent fragmentation process and the finite size of nuclei. The present status concerning the first point is presented. Simple classical models of disordered systems are derived starting with the generic bond percolation approach. These lattice and cellular equilibrium models, like percolation approaches, describe successfully experimental fragment multiplicity distributions. They also show the properties of systems which undergo a thermodynamic phase transition. Physical observables which are devised to show the existence and to fix the order of critical behaviour are presented. Applications to the models are shown. Thermodynamic properties of finite systems undergoing critical behaviour are advantageously described in the framework of the microcanonical ensemble. Applications to the designed models and to experimental data are presented and analysed. Perspectives of further developments of the field are suggested.},

The logarithmic slopes α and β′ of the residue yield ratios with respect to residue neutron number N and neutron excess N−Z are obtained as a function of the atomic number Z and mass number A, respectively, whereas excitation energies are deduced from velocities. The relation of the isoscaling parameters α and β′ with the N/Z of the primary (excited) projectile fragments is employed to gain access to the degree of N/Z equilibration prior to fragmentation as a function of excitation energy. A monotonic relation between the N/Z difference of fragmenting quasiprojectiles and their excitation energy is obtained indicating that N/Z equilibrium is approached at the highest observed excitation energies. Simulations with a deep-inelastic transfer model are in overall agreement with the isoscaling conclusions.

	abstract = {VMD is a molecular graphics program designed for the display and analysis of molecular assemblies, in particular biopolymers such as proteins and nucleic acids. VMD can simultaneously display any number of structures using a wide variety of rendering styles and coloring methods. Molecules are displayed as one or more “representations,” in which each representation embodies a particular rendering method and coloring scheme for a selected subset of atoms. The atoms displayed in each representation are chosen using an extensive atom selection syntax, which includes Boolean operators and regular expressions. VMD provides a complete graphical user interface for program control, as well as a text interface using the Tcl embeddable parser to allow for complex scripts with variable substitution, control loops, and function calls. Full session logging is supported, which produces a VMD command script for later playback. High-resolution raster images of displayed molecules may be produced by generating input scripts for use by a number of photorealistic image-rendering applications. VMD has also been expressly designed with the ability to animate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories, imported either from files or from a direct connection to a running MD simulation.

	abstract = {An extensive experimental survey of the features of the disassembly of a small quasiprojectile system with A{\textasciitilde}36, produced in the reactions of 47 MeV/nucleon Ar40+Al27, Ti48, and Ni58, has been carried out. Nuclei in the excitation energy range of 1–9 MeV/nucleon have been investigated employing a new method to reconstruct the quasiprojectile source. At an excitation energy ∼5.6 MeV/nucleon many observables indicate the presence of maximal fluctuations in the deexcitation processes. These include the normalized second moments of the Campi plot and normalized variances of the distributions of order parameters such as the atomic number of the heaviest fragment Zmax and the total kinetic energy. The evolution of the correlation of the atomic number of the heaviest fragment with that of the second heaviest fragment and a bimodality test are also consistent with a transition in the same excitation energy region. The related phase separation parameter, Sp, shows a significant change of slope at the same excitation energy. In the same region a Δ-scaling analysis for of the heaviest fragments exhibits a transition to Δ = 1 scaling, which is predicted to characterize a disordered phase. The fragment topological structure shows that the rank-sorted fragments obey Zipf's law at the point of largest fluctuations, providing another indication of a liquid gas phase transition. The Fisher droplet model critical exponent τ ∼ 2.3 obtained from the charge distribution at the same excitation energy is close to the critical exponent of the liquid gas phase transition universality class. The caloric curve for this system shows a monotonic increase of temperature with excitation energy and no apparent plateau. The temperature at the point of maximal fluctuations is 8.3±0.5MeV. Taking this temperature as the critical temperature and employing the caloric curve information we have extracted the critical exponents β,γ, and σ from the data. Their values are also consistent with the values of the universality class of the liquid gas phase transition. Taken together, this body of evidence strongly suggests a phase change in an equilibrated mesoscopic system at, or extremely close to, the critical point.},

For a range of densities, one can observe a liquid droplet (at density ρ′ℓ slightly exceeding ρℓ) coexisting in stable thermal equilibrium with surrounding vapor (with density ρ′v{\textgreater}ρv, so in the thermodynamic limit such a vapor would be supersaturated). We show, via Monte Carlo simulations of a Lennard-Jones model of a fluid and based on a phenomenological thermodynamic analysis, that via recording the chemical potential μ as function of ρ, one can obtain precise estimates of the droplet surface free energy for a wide range of droplet radii. We also show that the deviations of this surface free energy from the prediction based on the “capillarity approximation” of classical nucleation theory (i.e., using the interfacial free energy of a flat liquid-vapor interface for the surface free energy of a droplet irrespective of its radius) are rather small. We also study carefully the limitation of the present method due to the “droplet evaporation/condensation transition” occurring for small volumes and demonstrate that very good equilibrium is achieved in our study, by showing that the radial profile of the local chemical potential from the droplet center to the outside is perfectly flat.},

Event sorting has been achieved through the transverse energy of light charged particles emitted on the quasi-target side, thus avoiding artificial correlations between the bimodality signal and the sorting variable. Bimodality is observed for intermediate impact parameters for which the quasi-projectile is identified. A simulation shows that the deexcitation step rather than the geometry of the collision appears responsible for the bimodal behaviour. The influence of mid-rapidity emission has been verified. The two bumps of the bimodal distribution correspond to different excitation energies and similar temperatures. It is also shown that it is possible to correlate the bimodality signal with a change in the distribution of the heaviest fragment charge and a peak in potential energy fluctuations. All together, this set of data is coherent with what would be expected in a finite system if the corresponding system in the thermodynamic limit exhibits a first order phase transition.},

In the framework of classical Lennard-Jones molecular dynamics, we study how the relaxation of the fixed volume constraint affects the posterior evolution of microscopic correlations, and how a nonconfined fragmentation scenario is established. A study of the dynamical evolution of the relative kinetic energy fluctuations was also performed.

The study of this natural occurring objects can lead to further understanding of the behaviour of nuclear matter in highly asymmetric nuclei. Among the characteristics of neutron stars, its neutrino absorption - associated to structural inhomoegeneities - stands out as one of the possible magnitudes linked to an observable. Purpose: We have carried out a systematic study of this neutrino absorption for different thermodynamic conditions in order to assess the impact that the structure has on it. Method: We study the dynamics of nucleons in conditions according to the neutron star crust with a semiclassical molecular dynamics model, for different densities, proton fractions and temperature, we calculate the long range opacity and the cluster distribution. Results: The neutrino absorption, the main mechanism for neutron stars cooldown, takes its highest value for temperatures and densities low compared with the inner crust, and a proton fraction is close to the symmetric case \$x=0.5\$. Conclusions: Within the used model the neutrinos are absorbed mostly close to the surface of the neutron star. Also, for high temperatures, a large cluster still exists, but the appearance of several small-sized clusters smears out the very long range order needed for neutrino absorption.},

Its discussions of formalism and applications move easily between general theory and direct use by offering illustrations of principles to specific cases. Chapters on second quantization and statistical mechanics introduce students to ground-state (zero-temperature) formalism, which is explored by way of Green’s functions and field theory (fermions), Fermi systems, linear response and collective modes, and Bose systems. Finite-temperature formalism is examined through field theory at finite temperature, physical systems at finite temperature, and real-time Green’s functions and linear response. Additional topics cover canonical transformations and applications to physical systems in terms of nuclear matter, phonons and electrons, superconductivity, and superfluid helium as well as applications to finite systems. Graduate students will find this text enormously practical in making the transition from taking courses in quantum mechanics to interpreting the vast quantity of literature concerning the many-body problem.},

We focus on the fragmentation of small (100 constituents) systems. We use a molecular-dynamics method that simulates the behavior of condensed matter under homogeneous adiabatic expansion. Fragment formation is studied using a generalized version of the early cluster formation model (GECFM) which searches for the most bound density fluctuations in phase space. We show that the asymptotic fragment spectra is early realized in phase space not only for the total multiplicity but also for the populations of different mass ranges. In order to map the evolution of the system on the phase diagram of the small cell periodic one, its equation of state is calculated. It is shown that the fragmentation of the system cannot be unambiguously related to spinodal decomposition or nucleation processes. © 1996 The American Physical Society.},

The dynamics of core-collapse supernovae is very sensitive to the interactions between neutrinos and nucleons∕nuclei. Indeed, neutrino excitation of the low-energy modes of the pasta may allow for a significant energy transfer to the nuclear medium, thereby reviving the stalled supernovae shock. The linear response of the nuclear pasta to neutrinos is modeled via a simple semiclassical simulation. The transport mean free path for μ and τ neutrinos (and antineutrinos) is expressed in terms of the static structure factor of the pasta, which is evaluated using Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations.},

Since the considered nuclei have neutron excess, it has been suggested that the model dependence is due to the different behavior of the symmetry energy in different models. To clarify this issue, we make a systematic and careful analysis based on new Skyrme forces, which span a wide range of values for K∞, for the value of the symmetry energy at saturation and for its density dependence. By calculating, in a fully self-consistent fashion, the ISGMR centroid energy in Pb208, we reach three important conclusions: (i) the monopole energy, and consequently the deduced value of K∞, depend on a well-defined parameter related to the shape of the symmetry energy curve and called Ksym; (ii) Skyrme forces of the type of SLy4 predict K∞ around 230MeV, in agreement with the Gogny force (previous estimates using Skyrme interactions having been plagued by a lack of full self-consistency); (iii) it is possible to build forces which predict K∞ around 250MeV, although part of this increase is due to our poor knowledge of the density dependence and effective mass.},

It contains an adjustable nuclear force that accurately models both potential and mean-field interactions, and it allows for the input of various nuclear parameters, some of which are not yet experimentally well-determined. These include the bulk incompressibility parameter, the bulk and surface symmetry energies, the symmetric matter surface tension, and the nucleon effective masses. This permits parametric studies of the equation of state in astrophysical situations. The equation of state is modelled after the Lattimer, Lamb, Pethick and Ravenhall LLPR compressible liquid-drop model for nuclei, and includes the effects of interactions and degeneracy of the nucleons outside nuclei. Account is also taken of nuclear deformations and the phase transitions from nuclei to uniform nuclear matter at subnuclear densities. Comparisons of this equation of state are made to the results of the LLPR model and the Cooperstein-Baron equation of state. The effects of varying the bulk incompressibility are also investigated.},

	abstract = {There are at least two seemingly contradictory approaches to heavy ion collisions at intermediate energy: the nuclear gas and the nuclear liquid pictures. The idea of the nuclear gas, i.e., the Boltzmann transport equation (BEQ) with two body collisions, gives the space-time evolution of the one body distribution function in the case of a dilute fluid. The idea of the nuclear liquid, i.e., fluid dynamics, describes the dynamics in the case of a dense fluid. The conditions of validity of the BEQ and of fluid dynamics are neither satisfied for colliding nuclei at around 100 MeV/nucleon. The solution of a modified Boltzmann transport equation (MBEQ) with both two and three body collisions, the density dependent mean field, and the Pauli principle allows a more appropriate description. The basic theoretical ideas (as laid down by Wong in the previous decade) and computational ideas (as developed by many groups over the past decade) are described. The computer simulation is done using a very stable and robust Monte Carlo numerical method, which compares well with simple analytical models under restricted conditions, and aids in the understanding of the more complicated dynamics of nucleus-nucleus collisions. Inclusive cross sections, subthreshold particle production, above threshold particle production, and collective flow variables are well described by the model. Fluctuations are calculated in the small amplitude limit. Large fluctuations are discussed, as well as their relevance to fragmentation.},

	abstract = {The first results of a new three-dimensional, finite temperature Skyrme-Hartree-Fock+BCS study of the properties of inhomogeneous nuclear matter at densities and temperatures leading to the transition to uniform nuclear matter are presented. Calculations are carried out in a cubic box representing a unit cell of the locally periodic structure of the matter. A constraint is placed on the two independent components of the quadrupole moment of the neutron density to investigate the dependence of the total energy density of matter on the geometry of the nuclear structure in the unit cell. This approach allows self-consistent modeling of effects such as (i) neutron drip, resulting in a neutron gas external to the nuclear structure; (ii) shell effects of bound and unbound nucleons; (iii) the variety of exotic nuclear shapes that emerge, collectively termed nuclear pasta; and (iv) the dissolution of these structures into uniform nuclear matter as density and/or temperature increase. In Part I of this work the calculation of the properties of inhomogeneous nuclear matter in the core collapse of massive stars is reported. Emphasis is on exploring the effects of the numerical method on the results obtained; notably, the influence of the finite cell size on the nuclear shapes and energy-density obtained. Results for nuclear matter in β equilibrium in cold neutrons stars are the subject of Part II. The calculation of the band structure of unbound neutrons in neutron star matter, yielding thermal conductivity, specific heat, and entrainment parameters, is outlined in Part III. Calculations are performed at baryon number densities of nb=0.04-0.12 fm−3, a proton fraction of yp=0.3 and temperatures in the range 0–7.5 MeV. A wide variety of nuclear shapes are shown to emerge. It is suggested that thermodynamical properties change smoothly in the pasta regime up to the transition to uniform matter; at that transition, thermodynamic properties of the matter vary discontinuously, indicating a phase transition of first or second order. The calculations are carried out using the SkM∗ Skyrme parametrization; a comparison with calculations using Sly4 at nb=0.08 fm−3, T=0 MeV is made.},

Problems on Statistical Mechanics provides over 120 problems with model solutions, illustrating both basic principles and applications that range from solid-state physics to cosmology. An introductory chapter provides a summary of the basic concepts and results that are needed to tackle the problems, and also serves to establish the notation that is used throughout the book. The problems themselves occupy five chapters, progressing from the simpler aspects of thermodynamics and equilibrium statistical ensembles to the more challenging ideas associated with strongly interacting systems and nonequilibrium processes. Comprehensive solutions to all of the problems are designed to illustrate efficient and elegant problem-solving techniques. Where appropriate, the authors incorporate extended discussions of the points of principle that arise in the course of the solutions. The appendix provides useful mathematical formulae.},

It is shown that the resulting CC for the constrained case differ from the one in the unconstrained case, mainly in the presence of a “vapor branch.” This branch is absent in the free expanding case even at high energies. This effect is traced to the role played by the collective expansion motion. On the other hand, we found that the recently proposed characteristic features of a first order phase transition taking place in a finite isolated system, i.e., abnormally large kinetic energy fluctuations and a negative branch in the TRF, are present for the constrained (dilute) as well as the unconstrained case. The microscopic origin of this behavior is also analyzed.},

The scale of these simulations requires that optimizations are incorporated into every operation VisIt performs. But the set of applicable optimizations that VisIt can perform is dependent on the types of operations being done. Complicating the issue, VisIt has a plugin capability that allows new, unforeseen components to be added, making it even harder to determine which optimizations can be applied. We introduce the concept of a contract to the standard data flow network design. This contract enables each component of the data flow network to modify the set of optimizations used. In addition, the contract allows for new components to be accommodated gracefully within VisIt's data flow network system.},

Both models give the empirical energy and density of nuclear matter; however, the compressibility is 250 MeV for one and 535 MeV for the other. Exact simulations of La+La and Au+Au collisions at 50 to 600 MeV/nucleon laboratory energies indicate that these models are not totally unrealistic and may be pedagogically useful. The results also indicate that collisions at Elab≳400 MeV/nucleon are more sensitive to the interaction model. The models are then used to study the accuracy of the Vlasov-Nordheim approximation in the classical limit by comparing its results for equal mass (A=50) collisions with the exact results at Elab≳450 MeV/nucleon. We find that it is a reasonable approximation and it reproduces most of the observed effects when the known equation of state (EOS) and collision cross sections (σeff) are used. However, it appears difficult to determine both the EOS and σeff by fitting the exact results with VN simulations.},

The imaginary time step method is used to solve the Euler-Lagrange equation derived from the variational principle applied to the semiclassical energy density. It is shown that with increasing density, the spherical nuclei become more neutron rich and eventually merge to form a uniform liquid of neutrons, protons, and electrons. We find that the smaller the value of the incompressibility K, the lower the density at which the phase transition to uniform matter occurs. The relativistic extended Thomas-Fermi method is generalized to investigate nonspherical nuclei. Our results show that the spherical nucleus phase is the only equilibrium state in the inner crusts of neutron stars.},

It is shown, first, that with the assumption of fair sampling and with homogeneous probabilities it is possible to solve the problem analytically. Second, numerical percolations of hundreds of thousands of grids of different sizes and with different N to Z ratios confirm this prediction with remarkable agreement. It is thus concluded that isoscaling emerges even in the simple case of a classical non-interacting system such as two-species percolation under the assumption of fair sampling; if put in the nomenclature of the minimum information theory, isoscaling in percolation appears to require nothing more than the existence of equiprobable configurations in maximum entropy states.},

	abstract = {Computational modelling techniques are now widely employed in materials science, due to recent advances in computing power and simulation methodologies, since they can enable rapid testing of theoretical predictions or understanding of complex experimental data at relatively low cost. However, many problems at the leading edge of materials science involve collective phenomena that occur over a range of time and length scales which are intrinsically difficult to capture in a single simulation. This review summarises some of the latest developments in multiscale modelling techniques over the past decade, as applied to selected problems in materials science and engineering, thereby motivating the reader to explore how such techniques might be applied in their own area of specialty. Methods for accelerating molecular dynamics by enhancement of kinetic barrier crossing, such as hyperdynamics and metadynamics, are discussed alongside mesoscale simulation techniques, such as dissipative particle dynamics or adaptive coarse graining, for enabling larger and longer simulations. The applications are mainly focused on simulations of microstructure and mechanical properties, and examples of surface diffusion in metals, radiation damage in ceramics, strengthening of nanocrystalline metals and alloys, crack propagation in brittle solids, polymer chain relaxation in nanocomposites and the control of nucleation in biomimetic materials are discussed.},

A new event by event effective thermometer is proposed based on the energy balance. A peak in the energy fluctuations is observed related to the heat capacity suggesting that the system undergoes a liquid-gas type phase transition at an excitation energy ∼ 5 A MeV and a temperature 4–6 MeV, dependent on the freeze-out hypothesis. By analyzing different regions of the Campiplot, the events associated with the liquid and gas phases as well as the critical region are thermodynamically characterized.

The critical exponents, τ, β, γ, extracted from the high moments of the charge distribution are consistent with a liquid-gas type phase transition.},

Even though the primary isotope distributions are quite different from the final distributions due to evaporation from the excited fragments, the values of α and β are not much affected by sequential decays. α is shown to be mainly sensitive to the proton-to-neutron composition of the emitting source and may be used to study isospin-dependent properties in nuclear collisions, such as, the symmetry energy in the equation of state of asymmetric nuclear matter.},

	abstract = {By exploiting Coulomb dissociation of high-energy radioactive beams of the neutron-rich nuclei Sn129−132 and Sb133,134, their dipole-strength distributions have been measured. A sizable fraction of “pygmy” dipole strength, energetically located below the giant dipole resonance, is observed in all of these nuclei. A comparison with available pygmy resonance data in stable nuclei (Pb208 and N=82 isotones) indicates a trend of strength increasing with the proton-to-neutron asymmetry. On theoretical grounds, employing the RQRPA approach, a one-to-one correlation is found between the pygmy strength and parameters describing the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy, and in turn with the thicknesses of the neutron skins. On this basis, by using the experimental pygmy strength, parameters of the nuclear symmetry energy (a4=32.0±1.8 MeV and po=2.3±0.8 MeV/fm3) are deduced as well as neutron-skin thicknesses Rn−Rp of 0.24±0.04 fm for Sn132 and of 0.18±0.035 fm for Pb208, both doubly magic nuclei. Astrophysical implications with regard to neutron stars are briefly addressed.},

The shrinking effect is expected to change the diffusion property of nucleons in nuclear matter and the global one-body dynamics. The central 129Xe+Sn collisions at 50 MeV/nucleon are calculated by the models with and without shrinking, and it is shown that the inclusion of the wave packet shrinking has a large effect on the multifragmentation in a big expanding system with a moderate expansion velocity.},

Based on concepts of integral geometry, it involves the calculation of the Minkowski functionals of black-and-white images representing the patterns. The result of this approach is an objective, numerical characterization of a given pattern. We briefly review the basic elements of morphological image processing, a technique to transform images to patterns that are amenable to further morphological image analysis. The image processing technique is applied to electron microscope images of nano-ceramic particles and metal-oxide precipitates. The emphasis of this review is on the practical aspects of the integral-geometry-based morphological image analysis but we discuss its mathematical foundations as well. Applications to simple lattice structures, triply periodic minimal surfaces, and the Klein bottle serve to illustrate the basic steps of the approach. More advanced applications include random point sets, percolation and complex structures found in block copolymers.},

In our simulations, we also observe intermediate phases, which have complicated nuclear shapes. It has been found out that these phases can be characterized as those with negative Euler characteristic. Our result implies the existence of these kinds of phases in addition to the simple “pasta” phases in neutron star crusts and supernova inner cores. In addition, we investigate the properties of the effective QMD interaction used in the present work to examine the validity of our results.

We conclude—as others have before us using different techniques—that the proton fraction in the inner stellar crust is very small. Given that the purported nuclear pasta phase in stellar crusts develops as a consequence of the long-range Coulomb interaction among protons, we question whether pasta formation is possible in such proton-poor environments. To answer this question, we search for physical observables sensitive to the transition between spherical nuclei and exotic pasta structures. Of particular relevance is the static structure factor S(k)—an observable sensitive to density fluctuations. However, no dramatic behavior was observed in S(k). We regard the identification of physical observables sensitive to the existence—or lack thereof—of a pasta phase in proton-poor environments as an open problem of critical importance.},

There are three fundamental PMS: the G, D, and P types. These three and no others have been observed in lipid–water systems. Due to the so-called Bonnet relation, the PMS structures are isometric conjugates to one another at coexistence, which determines the cubic axis ratio and water content at equilibrium. A number of lipid systems exhibiting coexisting cubic phases have been examined in relation to fulfilling the Bonnet relation. In all cases with known unit cell dimensions, the phases are Bonnet-related. This is regarded as strong evidence for their PMS structure. The phase transitions in relation to swelling and water content also fulfill the Bonnet relations. Aside from bulk phases with PMS structure, it has also been shown possible to produce nanoparticles with internal PMS structure. New developments enable the manufacturing of such particles with uniform size and internal structure, of interest in practical applications such as in vivo delivery of drugs.},

	abstract = {We investigate neutrino-driven convection in core collapse supernovae and its ramifications for the explosion mechanism. We begin with a postbounce model that is optimistic in two important respects: (1) we begin with a 15 M☉ precollapse model, which is representative of the class of stars with compact iron cores; (2) we implement Newtonian gravity. Our precollapse model is evolved through core collapse and bounce in one dimension using multigroup (neutrino energy-dependent) flux-limited diffusion (MGFLD) neutrino transport and Newtonian Lagrangian hydrodynamics, providing realistic initial conditions for the postbounce convection and evolution. Our two-dimensional simulation begins at 12 ms after bounce and proceeds for 500 ms. We couple two-dimensional piecewise parabolic method (PPM) hydrodynamics to precalculated one-dimensional MGFLD neutrino transport. (The neutrino distributions used for matter heating and deleptonization in our two-dimensional run are obtained from an accompanying one-dimensional simulation. The accuracy of this approximation is assessed.) For the moment, we sacrifice dimensionality for realism in other aspects of our neutrino transport. MGFLD is an implementation of neutrino transport that simultaneously (1) is multigroup and (2) simulates with sufficient realism the transport of neutrinos in opaque, semitransparent, and transparent regions. Both are crucial to the accurate determination of postshock neutrino heating, which sensitively depends on the luminosities, spectra, and flux factors of the electron neutrinos and antineutrinos emerging from their respective neutrinospheres. By 137 ms after bounce, we see neutrino-driven convection rapidly developing beneath the shock. By 212 ms after bounce, this convection becomes large scale, characterized by higher entropy, expanding upflows and lower entropy, denser, finger-like downflows. The upflows reach the shock and distort it from sphericity. The radial convection velocities at this time become supersonic just below the shock, reaching magnitudes in excess of 109 cm s-1. Eventually, however, the shock recedes to smaller radii, and at {\textasciitilde}500 ms after bounce there is no evidence in our simulation of an explosion or of a developing explosion. Our angle-averaged density, entropy, electron fraction, and radial velocity profiles in our two-dimensional model agree well with their counterparts in our accompanying one-dimensional MGFLD run above and below the neutrino-driven convection region. In the convection region, the one-dimensional and angle-averaged profiles differ somewhat because (1) convection tends to flatten the density, entropy, and electron fraction profiles, and (2) the shock radius is boosted somewhat by convection. However, the differences are not significant, indicating that, while vigorous, neutrino-driven convection in our model does not have a significant impact on the overall shock dynamics. The differences between our results and those of other groups are considered. These most likely result from differences in (1) numerical hydrodynamics methods; (2) initial postbounce models, and, most important; (3) neutrino transport approximations. We have compared our neutrino luminosities, rms energies, and inverse flux factors with those from the exploding models of other groups. Above all, we find that the neutrino rms energies computed by our multigroup (MGFLD) transport are significantly lower than the values obtained by Burrows and coworkers, who specified their neutrino spectra by tying the neutrino temperature to the matter temperature at the neutrinosphere and by choosing the neutrino degeneracy parameter arbitrarily, and by Herant and coworkers in their transport scheme, which (1) is gray and (2) patches together optically thick and thin regions. The most dramatic difference between our results and those of Janka and Müller is exhibited by the difference in the net cooling rate below the gain radii: Our rate is 2-3 times greater during the critical 50-100 ms after bounce. We have computed the mass and internal energy in the gain region as a function of time. Up to {\textasciitilde}150 ms after bounce, we find that both increase as a result of the increasing gain region volume, as the gain and shock radii diverge. However, at all subsequent times, we find that the mass and internal energy in the gain region decrease with time in accordance with the density falloff in the preshock region and with the flow of matter into the gain region at the shock and out of the gain region at the gain radius. Therefore, we see no evidence in the simulations presented here that neutrino-driven convection leads to mass and energy accumulation in the gain region. We have compared our one- and two-dimensional densities, temperatures, and electron fractions in the region below the electron neutrino and antineutrino gain radii, above which the neutrino luminosities are essentially constant (i.e., the neutrino sources are entirely enclosed), in an effort to assess how spherically symmetric our neutrino sources remain during our two-dimensional evolution, and therefore, in an effort to assess our use of precalculated one-dimensional MGFLD neutrino distributions in calculating the matter heating and deleptonization. We find no difference below the neutrinosphere radii. Between the neutrinosphere and gain radii we find no differences with obvious ramifications for the supernova outcome. We note that the interplay between neutrino transport and convection below the neutrinospheres is a delicate matter and is discussed at greater length in another paper (Mezzacappa and coworkers). However, the results presented therein do support our use of precalculated one-dimensional MGFLD in the present context. Failure in our optimistic 15 M☉ Newtonian model leads us to conclude that it is unlikely, at least in our approximation, that neutrino-driven convection will lead to explosions for more massive stars with fatter iron cores or in cases in which general relativity is included.},

	abstract = {Over the past 60 years, a considerable number of theories and experiments have claimed the existence of negative absolute temperature in spin systems and ultracold quantum gases. This has led to speculation that ultracold gases may be dark-energy analogues and also suggests the feasibility of heat engines with efficiencies larger than one. Here, we prove that all previous negative temperature claims and their implications are invalid as they arise from the use of an entropy definition that is inconsistent both mathematically and thermodynamically. We show that the underlying conceptual deficiencies can be overcome if one adopts a microcanonical entropy functional originally derived by Gibbs. The resulting thermodynamic framework is self-consistent and implies that absolute temperature remains positive even for systems with a bounded spectrum. In addition, we propose a minimal quantum thermometer that can be implemented with available experimental techniques.},

	abstract = {Nonuniform neutron-rich matter present in both core-collapse supernovae and neutron-star crusts is described in terms of a semiclassical model that reproduces nuclear-matter properties and includes long-range Coulomb interactions. The neutron-neutron correlation function and the corresponding static structure factor are calculated from molecular dynamics simulations involving 40 000 to 100 000 nucleons. The static structure factor describes coherent neutrino scattering which is expected to dominate the neutrino opacity. At low momentum transfers the static structure factor is found to be small because of ion screening. In contrast, at intermediate momentum transfers the static structure factor displays a large peak due to coherent scattering from all the neutrons in a cluster. This peak moves to higher momentum transfers and decreases in amplitude as the density increases. A large static structure factor at zero momentum transfer, indicative of large density fluctuations during a first-order phase transition, may increase the neutrino opacity. However, no evidence of such an increase has been found. Therefore, it is unlikely that the system undergoes a simple first-order phase transition. Further, to compare our results to more conventional approaches, a cluster algorithm is introduced to determine the composition of the clusters in our simulations. Neutrino opacities are then calculated within a single heavy nucleus approximation as is done in most current supernova simulations. It is found that corrections to the single heavy nucleus approximation first appear at a density of the order of 1013g/cm3 and increase rapidly with increasing density. Thus neutrino opacities are overestimated in the single heavy nucleus approximation relative to the complete molecular dynamics simulations.},

Spherical, rod-like and slab-like nuclei as well as spherical and rod-like nuclear bubbles are taken into account by using a compressible liquid-drop model. This model is designed to incorporate uncertainties in the nuclear surface tension and in the proton chemical potential in a gas of dripped neutrons. The resultant phase diagrams show that for typical values of these quantities, the phases with rod-like nuclei and with slab-like nuclei occur in the form of Coulomb lattice at densities below a point where the system becomes uniform. Thermal fluctuations leading to displacements of such nuclei from their equilibrium positions are considered through explicit evaluations of their elastic constants; these fluctuations can be effective at destroying the layered lattice of slab-like nuclei in the temperature region typical of matter in the neutron star crust.},

	abstract = {In the molecular dynamics simulation method for fluids, the equations of motion for a collection of particles in a fixed volume are solved numerically. The energy, volume, and number of particles are constant for a particular simulation, and it is assumed that time averages of properties of the simulated fluid are equal to microcanonical ensemble averages of the same properties. In some situations, it is desirable to perform simulations of a fluid for particular values of temperature and/or pressure or under conditions in which the energy and volume of the fluid can fluctuate. This paper proposes and discusses three methods for performing molecular dynamics simulations under conditions of constant temperature and/or pressure, rather than constant energy and volume. For these three methods, it is shown that time averages of properties of the simulated fluid are equal to averages over the isoenthalpic–isobaric, canonical, and isothermal–isobaric ensembles. Each method is a way of describing the dynamics of a certain number of particles in a volume element of a fluid while taking into account the influence of surrounding particles in changing the energy and/or density of the simulated volume element. The influence of the surroundings is taken into account without introducing unwanted surface effects. Examples of situations where these methods may be useful are discussed.},

	abstract = {A great many observables seen in intermediate energy heavy ion collisions can be explained on the basis of statistical equilibrium. Calculations based on statistical equilibrium can be implemented in microcanonical ensemble (energy and number of particles in the system are kept fixed), canonical ensemble (temperature and number of particles are kept fixed) or grand canonical ensemble (fixed temperature and a variable number of particles but with an assigned average). This paper deals with calculations with canonical ensembles. A recursive relation developed recently allows calculations with arbitrary precision for many nuclear problems. Calculations are done to study the nature of phase transition in intermediate energy heavy ion collision, to study the caloric curves for nuclei and to explore the possibility of negative specific heat because of the finiteness of nuclear systems. The model can also be used for detailed calculations of other observables not connected with phase transitions, such as populations of selected isotopes in a heavy ion collision.

The model also serves a pedagogical purpose. For the problems at hand, both the canonical and grand canonical solutions are obtainable with arbitrary accuracy hence we can compare the values of observables obtained from the canonical calculations with those from the grand canonical. Sometimes, very interesting discrepancies are found.

To illustrate the predictive power of the model, calculated observables are compared with data from the central collisions of Sn isotopes.},

It covers geometrically 90\% of the 4π solid angle and has very low detection thresholds. The detector, operated under vacuum, is axially symmetric and segmented in 336 independent cells allowing efficient detection of high multiplicity events. Nucleus identification down to very low energy threshold (≈ 1 A MeV) is achieved by using ionization chambers operated with low pressure C3F8 gas. Residual energies are measured by a combination of silicon (300 μm thick) and cesium iodide (5 to 14 cm in length) detectors. Very forward angles are covered by fast counting phoswich scintillators (NE102/NE115). Charge resolution up to Z = 50 is achieved on a large energy dynamic range (5000 to 1 for silicon detectors). Isotopic separation is obtained up to Z = 3. The treatment of the signals is performed through specifically designed and highly integrated modules, most of which are in the new VXIbus standard. Full remote control of parameter settings, including visualization of signals, is thus allowed. The detector is continuously monitored with a laser source and electronic pulsers and is found stable over several days. Energy calibration procedures, making use of specific detectors and the ability of the GANIL accelerator to deliver secondary beams, have been developed. First experiments were performed in the spring of 1993.},

	abstract = {The growing adoption of generalized-ensemble algorithms for biomolecular simulation has resulted in a resurgence in the use of the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) to make use of all data generated by these simulations. Unfortunately, the original presentation of WHAM by Kumar et al. is not directly applicable to data generated by these methods. WHAM was originally formulated to combine data from independent samplings of the canonical ensemble, whereas many generalized-ensemble algorithms sample from mixtures of canonical ensembles at different temperatures. Sorting configurations generated from a parallel tempering simulation by temperature obscures the temporal correlation in the data and results in an improper treatment of the statistical uncertainties used in constructing the estimate of the density of states. Here we present variants of WHAM, STWHAM and PTWHAM, derived with the same set of assumptions, that can be directly applied to several generalized ensemble algorithms, including simulated tempering, parallel tempering (better known as replica-exchange among temperatures), and replica-exchange simulated tempering. We present methods that explicitly capture the considerable temporal correlation in sequentially generated configurations using autocorrelation analysis. This allows estimation of the statistical uncertainty in WHAM estimates of expectations for the canonical ensemble. We test the method with a one-dimensional model system and then apply it to the estimation of potentials of mean force from parallel tempering simulations of the alanine dipeptide in both implicit and explicit solvent.},

In this paper, we present a continuation of previous work implementing algorithms for using accelerators into the LAMMPS molecular dynamics software for distributed memory parallel hybrid machines. In our previous work, we focused on acceleration for short-range models with an approach intended to harness the processing power of both the accelerator and (multi-core) CPUs. To augment the existing implementations, we present an efficient implementation of long-range electrostatic force calculation for molecular dynamics. Specifically, we present an implementation of the particle–particle particle-mesh method based on the work by Harvey and De Fabritiis. We present benchmark results on the Keeneland InfiniBand GPU cluster. We provide a performance comparison of the same kernels compiled with both CUDA and OpenCL.

The liquid-gas phase transition plays an important role in the multiple fission of expanding charged liquid drops. There also appears to be a window in the initial conditions in which binary fission followed by a density oscillation is the dominant mode of breakup. The multiple and binary fission breakups are due to the Coulomb forces, and they yield more massive clusters with relatively few small clusters with ∼10 particles. The higher energy fragmentation and total vaporization modes are not significantly influenced by the Coulomb forces. They are primarily due to the liquid-gas transition, and their yields decrease almost monotonically with the number of particles in the cluster.},

This theory keeps track of the correlations and therefore allows for a selfconsistent theoretical description of the entire complex dynamics of heavy ion collisions, from the initial non-equilibrium penetration stage via the high density phase to the final formation of complex — stable and unstable — fragments. The cluster formation is caused by correlations and density fluctuations. We find that global equilibrium is not established in the course of the reaction. The form of the mass yield curve agrees with experimental findings. We also study the recently observed collective flow effects and find a strong dependence on the nuclear equation of state.},

	abstract = {This review is devoted to the Statistical Multifragmentation Model (SMFM) developed in Copenhagen more than 10 years ago and widely used now for interpreting experimental data on multiple fragment production in different nuclear reactions. The model is based on the assumption of simultaneous break-up of a thermalized nuclear system. Basic principles and different realizations of the statistical approach to the nuclear multifragmentation are described in detail. Special emphasis is put on the implementation of specific nuclear features such as finite size effects, internal excitation of fragments, their strong and Coulomb interaction. Hot primary fragments are treated within the liquid-drop approximation. An efficient Monte Carlo method is proposed for generating microcanonical ensembles of break-up channels. Deexcitation of hot fragments via evaporation and Fermi break-up is also included in the numerical code. The evolution of nuclear disintegration mechanisms with increasing excitation energy, from compound nucleus to multifragmentation and vaporization, follows naturally from the model. Observable signals of multifragmentation are discussed and numerous applications of the model for analyzing experimental data are demonstrated. In particular, hybrid models, combining dynamical simulations of non-equilibrium stages of the reaction with statistical break-up of thermalized intermediate systems, are described. The “backtracing” method of reconstructing parameters of decaying sources from experimental data is also presented.},

	abstract = {We investigate the dynamics and evolution of coalescing neutron stars. Although the code (Piecewise Parabolic Method) is purely Newtonian, we do include the emission of gravitational waves and their backreaction on the hydrodynamic flow. The properties of neutron star matter are described by the physical equation of state of Lattimer {\textbackslash}\& Swesty (1991). Energy loss by all types of neutrinos and changes of the electron fraction due to the emission of electron neutrinos and antineutrinos are taken into account by an elaborate ``neutrino leakage scheme''. We simulate the coalescence of two identical, cool neutron stars with a baryonic mass of \${\textbackslash}approx{\textbackslash}!1.6{\textbackslash},M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ and a radius of \${\textbackslash}approx{\textbackslash}!15\${\textasciitilde}km and with an initial center-to-center distance of 42{\textasciitilde}km. The initial distributions of density and electron concentration are given from a model of a cold neutron star in hydrostatic equilibrium (central temperature about \$8{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm MeV\}\$). We investigate three cases which differ by the initial velocity distribution in the neutron stars, representing different cases of the neutron star spins relative to the direction of the orbital angular momentum vector. Within about 1{\textasciitilde}ms the neutron stars merge into a rapidly spinning (\$P\_\{{\textbackslash}rm spin\}{\textbackslash}approx 1\${\textasciitilde}ms), high-density body (\${\textbackslash}rho{\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}\${\textasciitilde}g/cm\${\textasciicircum}3\$) with a surrounding thick disk of material with densities \${\textbackslash}rho{\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}\${\textasciitilde}g/cm\${\textasciicircum}3\$ and orbital velocities of{\textasciitilde}0.3--0.5{\textasciitilde}c. In this work we evaluate the models in detail with respect to the gravitational wave emission using the quadrupole approximation. In a forthcoming paper we will concentrate on the neutrino emission and implications for gamma-ray bursters. A maximum luminosity in excess of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{55\}\${\textasciitilde}erg/s is reached for about 1{\textasciitilde}ms.},

We emphasize recent theoretical achievements, for instance, band structure effects in neutrino emission due to scattering of electrons in Coulomb crystals of atomic nuclei. We consider the standard composition of matter (neutrons, protons, electrons, muons, hyperons) in the core, and also the case of exotic constituents such as the pion or kaon condensates and quark matter. We discuss the reduction of the neutrino emissivities by nucleon superfluidity, as well as the specific neutrino emission produced by Cooper pairing of the superfluid particles. We also analyze the effects of strong magnetic fields on some reactions, such as the direct Urca process and the neutrino synchrotron emission of electrons. The results are presented in the form convenient for practical use. We illustrate the effects of various neutrino reactions on the cooling of neutron stars. In particular, the neutrino emission in the crust is critical in setting the initial thermal relaxation between the core and the crust. Finally, we discuss the prospects of exploring the properties of supernuclear matter by confronting cooling simulations with observations of the thermal radiation from isolated neutron stars.},

If this is the case, the observed fragment multiplicity should be directly related to those initial fluctuations and to the conditions of temperature and density causing them. The feasibility of this scenario is demonstrated with a molecular dynamics study of the evolution of mass and energy fluctuations, and fluctuations of the phase-space density. First, it is verified that the fluctuations leading to fragmentation are indeed early ones. Second, it is determined that different initial conditions of density and temperature can indeed produce varying final fragment multiplicities. The ρ-T plane is mapped to the fragment multiplicity with good precision. This mapping should be easily reproducible with existing experimental data.},

A random walk in the two-dimensional space of particle number and energy is used to estimate the density of states of the system; this density of states is continuously updated as the random walk visits individual states. The validity and usefulness of the method are demonstrated by applying it to the simulation of a Lennard-Jones fluid. Results for its thermodynamic properties, including the vapor–liquid phase coexistence curve, are shown to be in good agreement with high-accuracy literature data.},

Geometrical structures of matter are analyzed with Minkowski functionals, and it is found that intermediate phases can be characterized as those with negative Euler characteristic.

The successful calculation of critical exponents for continuous phase transitions is one of the main achievements of theoretical physics over the last quarter-century. This was achieved through the use of scaling and field theoretic techniques which have since become standard equipment in many areas of physics, especially quantum field theory. This book provides a thorough introduction to these techniques, one that assumes only a sound undergraduate background in physics and mathematics. Continuous phase transitions are introduced, then the necessary statistical mechanics is summarized, followed by standard models, some exact solutions and techniques for numerical simulations. The real space renormalization group and mean field theory are next explained and illustrated. The last eight chapters cover the Landau-Ginzburg model, from physical motivation, through diagrammatic perturbation theory and renormalization to the renormalization group and the calculation of critical exponents above and below the critical temperature.},

The results of such simulations agree that spherically symmetric models with standard microphysical input fail to explode by the delayed, neutrino-driven mechanism. Independent groups implemented fundamentally different numerical methods to tackle the Boltzmann neutrino transport equation. Here we present a direct and detailed comparison of such neutrino radiation-hydrodynamics simulations for two codes, AGILE-BOLTZTRAN of the Oak Ridge-Basel group and VERTEX of the Garching group. The former solves the Boltzmann equation directly by an implicit, general relativistic discrete-angle method on the adaptive grid of a conservative implicit hydrodynamics code with second-order TVD advection. In contrast, the latter couples a variable Eddington factor technique with an explicit, moving-grid, conservative high-order Riemann solver with important relativistic effects treated by an effective gravitational potential. The presented study is meant to test our neutrino radiation-hydrodynamics implementations and to provide a data basis for comparisons and verifications of supernova codes to be developed in the future. Results are discussed for simulations of the core collapse and postbounce evolution of a 13 M☉ star with Newtonian gravity and a 15 M☉ star with relativistic gravity.},

	abstract = {The problem of fragmentation of excited finite systems is explored in the frame of classical molecular dynamics experiments of two-dimensional Lennard-Jones drops. The main objective of this work is to get information about the relative value of the relevant characteristic time scales (CTS) for this kind of process. We investigate the CTS for fragment formation, the stabilization of the radial flux, and the internal “temperature.” It is found that the asymptotic fragments are realized early in phase space, when the system is still dense, by the time the radial flux attains its asymptotic value. It is also shown that the temperature of the system during the breakup is quite homogenous with respect to the expected profile if local thermal equilibration takes place. Special emphasis is put on the investigation of the time scale of stabilization of the statistical properties of the mass spectrum, which is related to the kind of information carried by the asymptotic fragments.},

This conclusion is considered to be general since it stems from a model-independent feature that the electron screening acts to decrease the density at which spherical nuclei become unstable against fission and to increase the density at which uniform matter becomes unstable against proton clustering.},

	abstract = {As a rule, mean-fieldtheories applied to a fluid that can undergo a transition from saturated vapor at density ρ υ to a liquid at density ρ ℓ yield a van der Waals loop. For example, isotherms of the chemical potential μ ( T , ρ ) as a function of the density ρ at a fixed temperature T less than the critical temperature T c exhibit a maximum and a minimum. Metastable and unstable parts of the van der Waals loop can be eliminated by the Maxwell construction. Van der Waals loops and the corresponding double minimum potentials are mean-field artifacts. Simulations at fixed μ = μ coex for ρ υ \&lt; ρ \&lt; ρ ℓ yield a loop, but for sufficiently large systems this loop does not resemble the van der Waals loop and reflects interfacial effects on phase coexistence due to finite size effects. In contrast to the van der Waals loop, all parts of the loop found in simulations are thermodynamically stable. The successive umbrella sampling algorithm is described as a convenient tool for seeing these effects. It is shown that the maximum of the loop is not the stability limit of a metastable vapor but signifies the droplet evaporation-condensation transition. The descending part of the loop contains information on Tolman-like corrections to the surface tension, rather than describing unstable states.},

	abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently—those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90\% and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.},

Of the large variety of forms of matter present in core-collapse supernova, we focus on the transitional region between homogeneous (uniform) and inhomogeneous (pasta) phases. A three-dimensional, finite temperature Skyrme-Hartree-Fock (3D-SHF)+BCS calculation yields, for the first time fully self-consistently, the critical density and temperature of both the onset of the pasta in inhomogeneous matter, consisting of neutron-rich heavy nuclei and a free neutron and electron gas, and its dissolution to a homogeneous neutron, proton, and electron liquid. We also identify density regions for different pasta formations between the two limits. We employ four different forms of the Skyrme interaction, SkM*, SLy4, NRAPR, and SQMC700 and find subtle variations in the low density and high density transitions into and out of the pasta phase. One new stable pasta shape has been identified, in addition to the classic ones, on the grid of densities and temperatures used in this work. Our results are critically compared to recent calculations of pasta formation in the quantum molecular dynamics approach and Thomas-Fermi and coexisting phase approximations to relativistic mean-field models.},

In particular, we study projection methods and methods based on local coordinates of the manifold defined by the invariants. We discuss in some detail the case where the manifold is a Lie group. Finally, we consider differential equations on manifolds with orthogonality constraints, which often arise in numerical linear algebra.},

After collapse, the shock wave moves outward, but probably does not succeed in expelling the mass of the star. The most likely mechanism to do so is the absorption of neutrinos from the core by the material at medium distances.

This softening appears to be required for an accurate description of several collective modes having different neutron-to-proton ratios.

	abstract = {A new classification of neutron star cooling scenarios, involving either minimal cooling or enhanced cooling, is proposed. The minimal cooling scenario replaces and extends the so-called standard cooling scenario to include neutrino emission from the Cooper pair breaking and formation process. This emission dominates that due to the modified Urca process for temperatures close to the critical temperature for superfluid pairing. Minimal cooling is distinguished from enhanced cooling by the absence of neutrino emission from any direct Urca process, due either to nucleons or to exotica such as hyperons, Bose condensates, or deconfined quarks. Within the minimal cooling scenario, theoretical cooling models can be considered to be a four parameter family involving the equation of state (including various compositional possibilities) of dense matter, superfluid properties of dense matter, the composition of the neutron star envelope, and the mass of the neutron star. The consequences of minimal cooling are explored through extensive variations of these parameters. The results are compared with the inferred properties of thermally emitting neutron stars in order to ascertain if enhanced cooling occurs in any of them. All stars for which thermal emissions have been clearly detected are at least marginally consistent with the lack of enhanced cooling, given the combined uncertainties in ages and temperatures or luminosities. The two pulsars PSR 0833-45 (Vela) and PSR 1706-44 would require enhanced cooling in case their ages and/or temperatures are on the lower side of their estimated values, whereas the four stars PSR 0656+14, PSR 1055-52, Geminga, and RX J0720.4-3125 may require some source of internal heating in case their age and/or luminosity are on the upper side of their estimated values. The new upper limits on the thermal luminosity of PSR J0205+6449 (in the supernova remnant 3C 58) and RX J0007.0+7302 (in CTA 1) are indicative of the occurrence of some enhanced neutrino emission beyond the minimal scenario.},

	abstract = {In this work we study molecular dynamics simulations of symmetric nuclear and neutron star matter using a semi-classical nucleon interaction model. Our aim is to gain insight on the nature of the so-called “finite size effects”, unavoidable in this kind of simulations, and to understand what they actually affect. To do so, we explore different geometries for the periodic boundary conditions imposed on the simulation cell: cube, hexagonal prism and truncated octahedron. For nuclear matter simulations we show that, at sub-saturation densities and low temperatures, the solutions are non-homogeneous structures reminiscent of the “nuclear pasta” phases expected in neutron star matter simulations, but only one structure per cell and shaped by specific artificial aspects of the simulations—for the same physical conditions (i.e. number density and temperature) different cells yield different solutions. The particular shape of the solution at low enough temperature and a given density can be predicted analytically by surface minimization. We also show that even if this behavior is due to the imposition of periodic boundary conditions on finite systems, this does not mean that it vanishes for very large systems, and it is actually independent of the system size. We conclude that, for nuclear matter simulations, the cells' size sets the only characteristic length scale for the inhomogeneities, and the geometry of the periodic cell determines the shape of those inhomogeneities.

To model neutron star matter we add a screened Coulomb interaction between protons, and perform simulations in the three cell geometries. Our simulations indeed produce the well known nuclear pasta, with (in most cases) several structures per cell. However, we find that for systems not too large results are affected by finite size in different ways depending on the geometry of the cell. In particular, at the same certain physical conditions and system size, the hexagonal prism yields a single structure per cell while the cubic and truncated octahedron show consistent results, with more than one structure per cell. For systems of the size studied in this work these effects are still noticeable, but we find evidence to support that the dependence of the results on the cell geometry becomes smaller as the system size is increased. When the Coulomb interaction is present, the competition between opposing interactions of different range results in a proper, physically meaningful length scale that is independent of the system size and periodic cell of choice. Only under these conditions “finite size effects” will vanish for large enough systems (i.e. cells much larger than this characteristic length). Larger simulations are in order, but our computational capabilities forbid it for the time being.},

	abstract = {It might be possible that thermodynamic properties of nuclear matter, such as the caloric curve, could be obtained from heavy-ion reactions. Recent experimental and computational studies of nuclear experiments have obtained contradictory caloric curves for nuclear matter. This work improves on previous theoretical studies by considering the fragmentation produced by collisions, and introducing the methodology needed to identify the fragments, their temperature, energy, and a caloric curve. The main findings are the crucial reduction of energy produced in the promptly emitted particles, the existence of a well-defined fragmentation time, the connection of the temperature of the detected fragments with that at fragmentation time, and the possibility of obtaining the caloric curve from collisions.},

	abstract = {Isotopic effects observed in fragmentation reactions induced by protons, deuterons, and α particles of incident energies between 660 MeV and 15.3 GeV on 112Sn and 124Sn targets are discussed. The exponential scaling of the yield ratios with the third component of the fragment isospin t3=(N-Z)/2 is observed in all reactions, with scaling parameters that depend on the incident energy. Breakup temperatures for these reactions are deduced from double ratios of isotopic yields and tested for their relation with the isoscaling parameters. The quantum-statistical and the statistical multifragmentation (SMM) models are used for interpreting the results. The observed isoscaling can be understood as a consequence of the statistical origin of the emitted fragments in these reactions. The SMM analysis shows that the exponent describing the isoscaling behavior is proportional to the strength of the symmetry term of the fragment binding energy. Using this result, a symmetry-term coefficient γ≈22.5MeV for fragments at breakup is deduced from the experimental data. This is close to the standard value and supports SMM assumptions for the breakup configuration. An alternative method of determining the symmetry-energy coefficient, by using isotope distribution widths, is also discussed.},

The electrostatic interaction between protons is included as a screened Coulomb potential in the spirit of the Thomas–Fermi approximation, but the screening length is artificially varied to explore its effect on the formation of the nonhomogeneous nuclear structures known as “nuclear pasta.” As the screening length increases, we can see a transition from a one-per-cell pasta regime (due exclusively to finite-size effects) to a more appealing multiple pasta per simulation box. This qualitative difference in the structure of neutron star matter at low temperatures shows that special caution should be taken when the screening length is estimated for numerical simulations.},

Here, aqueous proline is investigated by atomistic, replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations, and the results are compared to neutron diffraction and small angle neutron scattering (SANS) data, which have been reported recently (McLain, S.; Soper, A.; Terry, A.; Watts, A. J. Phys. Chem. B 2007, 111, 4568). Comparisons between neutron experiments and simulation are made via the static structure factor S(Q) which is measured and computed from several systems with different H/D isotopic compositions at a concentration of 1:20 molar ratio. Several different empirical water models (TIP3P, TIP4P, and SPC/E) in conjunction with the CHARMM22 force field are investigated. Agreement between experiment and simulation is reasonably good across the entire Q range although there are significant model-dependent variations in some cases. In general, agreement is improved slightly upon application of approximate quantum corrections obtained from gas-phase path integral simulations. Dimers and short oligomeric chains formed by hydrogen bonds (frequently bifurcated) coexist with apolar (hydrophobic) contacts. These emerge as the dominant local motifs in the mixture. Evidence for long-range association is more equivocal:? No long-range structures form spontaneously in the MD simulations, and no obvious low-Q signature is seen in the SANS data. Moreover, associations introduced artificially to replicate a long-standing proposed mesoscale structure for proline correlations as an initial condition are annealed out by parallel tempering MD simulations. However, some small residual aggregates do remain, implying a greater degree of long-range order than is apparent in the SANS data.},

Here we study r -process nucleosynthesis in material that is dynamically ejected by tidal and pressure forces during the merging of binary neutron stars (NSs) and within milliseconds afterward. For the first time we make use of relativistic hydrodynamical simulations of such events, defining consistently the conditions that determine the nucleosynthesis, i.e., neutron enrichment, entropy, early density evolution and thus expansion timescale, and ejecta mass. We find that 10 –3 -10 –2 M ☉ are ejected, which is enough for mergers to be the main source of heavy ( A \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] gsim 140) galactic r -nuclei for merger rates of some 10 –5 yr –1 . While asymmetric mergers eject 2-3 times more mass than symmetric ones, the exact amount depends weakly on whether the NSs have radii of 15 km for a "stiff" nuclear equation of state (EOS) or 12 km for a "soft" EOS. r -process nucleosynthesis during the decompression becomes largely insensitive to the detailed conditions because of efficient fission recycling, producing a composition that closely follows the solar r -abundance distribution for nuclei with mass numbers A {\textgreater} 140. Estimating the light curve powered by the radioactive decay heating of r -process nuclei with an approximative model, we expect high emission in the B - V - R bands for 1-2 days with potentially observable longer duration in the case of asymmetric mergers because of the larger ejecta mass.},

	abstract = {* Introducing a unique method to study the atomic structure of nano-materials* Award winning research. Takeshi Egami received the 2003 Eugene Bertram Warren Diffraction Physics Award for the work described in the book.This book focuses on the structural determination of crystalline solids with extensive disorder. Well-established methods exist for characterizing the structure of fully crystalline solids or fully disordered materials such as liquids and glasses, but there is a dearth of techniques for the cases in-between, crystalline solids with internal atomic and nanometer scale disorder. Egami and Billinge discuss how to fill the gap using modern tools of structural characterization. While this subject might sound rather narrow, the fact is that today this problem is encountered in the structural characterization of a surprisingly wide range of complex materials of interest to modern technology and is becoming increasingly important.},

It is found that the system shows a critical behavior at peripheral impact parameters, revealed through the analysis of conditional moments of charge distributions, Campi scatter plot, and the occurrence of large fluctuations in the region of the Campi plot where this critical behavior is expected. When applying the experimental filters of the MULTICS-MINIBALL apparatus, it is found that criticality signals can be hidden due to the inefficiency of the experimental apparatus. The signals are recovered by identifying semiperipheral and peripheral collisions looking to the velocity distribution of the largest fragment, and selecting the most complete events. © 1996 The American Physical Society.},

Data analysis techniques are also explained starting with straightforward measurement and error-estimation techniques and progressing to topics such as the single and multiple histogram methods and finite size scaling. The last few chapters of the book are devoted to implementation issues, including discussions of such topics as lattice representations, efficient implementation of data structures, multispin coding, parallelization of Monte Carlo algorithms, and random number generation.

Examples of problems in which knowledge of the underlying free energy behaviour is required, include conformational equilibria and molecular association, partitioning between immiscible liquids, receptor-drug interaction, protein-protein and protein-DNA association, and protein stability.  This volume sets out to present a coherent and comprehensive account of the concepts that underlie different approaches devised for the determination of free energies. The reader will gain the necessary insight into the theoretical and computational foundations of the subject and will be presented with relevant applications from molecular-level modelling and simulations of chemical and biological systems. Both formally accurate and approximate methods are covered using both classical and quantum mechanical descriptions. A central theme of the book is that the wide variety of free energy calculation techniques available today can be understood as different implementations of a few basic principles.

	abstract = {We study the thermal and chemical evolution during the Kelvin-Helmholtz phase of the birth of a neutron star, employing neutrino opacities that are consistently calculated with the underlying equation of state (EOS). Expressions for the diffusion coefficients appropriate for general relativistic neutrino transport in the equilibrium diffusion approximation are derived. The diffusion coefficients are evaluated using a field-theoretical finite-temperature EOS that includes the possible presence of hyperons. The variation of the diffusion coefficients is studied as a function of EOS and compositional parameters. We present results from numerical simulations of proto-neutron star cooling for internal stellar properties as well as emitted neutrino energies and luminosities. We discuss the influence of the initial stellar model, the total mass, the underlying EOS, and the addition of hyperons on the evolution of the proto-neutron star and on the expected signal in terrestrial detectors. We find that the differences in predicted luminosities and emitted neutrino energies do not depend much upon the details of the initial models or the underlying high-density EOS for early times ( t {\textless}10 s), provided that opacities are calculated consistently with the EOS. The same holds true for models that allow for the presence of hyperons, except when the initial mass is significantly larger than the maximum mass for cold, catalyzed matter. For times larger than about 10 s, and prior to the occurrence of neutrino transparency, the neutrino luminosities decay exponentially with a time constant that is sensitive to the high-density properties of matter. We also find the average emitted neutrino energy increases during the first 5 s of evolution and then decreases nearly linearly with time. In general, increasing the proto-neutron star mass increases the average energy and the luminosity of neutrinos, as well as the overall evolutionary timescale. The influence of hyperons or variations in the dense matter EOS is increasingly important at later times. Metastable stars, those with hyperons that are unstable to collapse upon deleptonization, have relatively long evolution times, which increase the nearer the mass is to the maximum mass supportable by a cold, deleptonized star.},

Sufficient material is ejected to explain the amount of r -process nuclei in the Galaxy by decompression of neutron star material.

	abstract = {Short-duration γ-ray bursts are intense flashes of cosmic γ-rays, lasting less than about two seconds, whose origin is unclear. The favoured hypothesis is that they are produced by a relativistic jet created by the merger of two compact stellar objects (specifically two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole). This is supported by indirect evidence such as the properties of their host galaxies, but unambiguous confirmation of the model is still lacking. Mergers of this kind are also expected to create significant quantities of neutron-rich radioactive species, whose decay should result in a faint transient, known as a /`kilonova/', in the days following the burst. Indeed, it is speculated that this mechanism may be the predominant source of stable r-process elements in the Universe. Recent calculations suggest that much of the kilonova energy should appear in the near-infrared spectral range, because of the high optical opacity created by these heavy r-process elements. Here we report optical and near-infrared observations that provide strong evidence for such an event accompanying the short-duration γ-ray burst GRB 130603B. If this, the simplest interpretation of the data, is correct, then it confirms that compact-object mergers are the progenitors of short-duration γ-ray bursts and the sites of significant production of r-process elements. It also suggests that kilonovae offer an alternative, unbeamed electromagnetic signature of the most promising sources for direct detection of gravitational waves.},

	abstract = {Background: Neutron stars are astronomical systems with nucleons submitted to extreme conditions. Due to the long range coulomb repulsion between protons, the system has structural inhomogeneities. These structural inhomogeneities arise also in expanding systems, where the fragment distribution is highly dependent on the thermodynamic conditions (temperature, proton fraction, ...) and the expansion velocity.
Purpose: We aim to find the different regimes of fragment distribution, and the existence of infinite clusters.
Method: We study the dynamics of the nucleons with a semiclassical molecular dynamics model. Starting with an equilibrium configuration, we expand the system homogeneously until we arrive to an asymptotic configuration (i. e. very low final densities). We study the fragment distribution throughout this expansion.
Results: We found the typical regimes of the asymptotic fragment distribution of an expansion: u-shaped, power law and exponential. Another key feature in our calculations is that, since the interaction between protons is long range repulsive, we do not have always an infinite fragment. We found that, as expected, the faster the expansion velocity is, the quicker the infinite fragment disappears.
Conclusions: We have developed a novel graph-based tool for the identification of infinite fragments, and found a transition from U-shaped to exponential fragment mass distribution with increasing expansion rate.},

This matter evolves into spherical, rod-like, and slab-like shapes and mixtures thereof. The simulations employ a full Skyrme interaction in a periodic three-dimensional grid. By an improved morphological analysis based on Minkowski functionals, all eight pasta shapes can be uniquely identified by the sign of only two valuations, namely the Euler characteristic and the integral mean curvature.

	abstract = {The formation of complex nonuniform phases of nuclear matter, known as nuclear pasta, is studied with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations containing 51200 nucleons. A phenomenological nuclear interaction is used that reproduces the saturation binding energy and density of nuclear matter. Systems are prepared at an initial density of 0.10fm−3 and then the density is decreased by expanding the simulation volume at different rates to densities of 0.01fm−3 or less. An originally uniform system of nuclear matter is observed to form spherical bubbles (“swiss cheese”), hollow tubes, flat plates (“lasagna”), thin rods (“spaghetti”) and, finally, nearly spherical nuclei with decreasing density. We explicitly observe nucleation mechanisms, with decreasing density, for these different pasta phase transitions. Topological quantities known as Minkowski functionals are obtained to characterize the pasta shapes. Different pasta shapes are observed depending on the expansion rate. This indicates nonequilibrium effects. We use this to determine the best ways to obtain lower energy states of the pasta system from MD simulations and to place constraints on the equilibration time of the system.},

	abstract = {We review a molecular dynamics method for nucleon many-body systems called quantum molecular dynamics (QMD), and our studies using this method. These studies address the structure and the dynamics of nuclear matter relevant to neutron star crusts, supernova cores, and heavy-ion collisions. A key advantage of QMD is that we can study dynamical processes of nucleon many-body systems without any assumptions about the nuclear structure. First, we focus on the inhomogeneous structures of low-density nuclear matter consisting not only of spherical nuclei but also of nuclear “pasta”, i.e., rod-like and slab-like nuclei. We show that pasta phases can appear in the ground and equilibrium states of nuclear matter without assuming nuclear shape. Next, we show our simulation of compression of nuclear matter which corresponds to the collapsing stage of supernovae. With the increase in density, a crystalline solid of spherical nuclei changes to a triangular lattice of rods by connecting neighboring nuclei. Finally, we discuss fragment formation in expanding nuclear matter. Our results suggest that a generally accepted scenario based on the liquid–gas phase transition is not plausible at lower temperatures.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.11084},
	abstract = {Background: Neutron stars are astronomical systems with nucleons submitted to extreme conditions. Due to the longer range coulomb repulsion between protons, the system has structural inhomogeneities. Several interactions tailored to reproduce nuclear matter plus screened Coulomb term reproduce these inhomogeneities known as nuclear pasta. These structural inhomogeneities, located in the crust of neutron stars, can also arise in expanding systems depending on the thermodynamic conditions (temperature, proton fraction, ...) and the expansion velocity. Purpose: We aim to find the dynamics of the fragments formation for expanding systems simulated according to the little big bang model. This expansion resembles the evolution of neutron stars merger. Method: We study the dynamics of the nucleons with semiclassical molecular dynamics models. Starting with an equilibrium configuration, we expand the system homogeneously until we arrive to an asymptotic configuration (i. e. very low final densities). We study, with four different cluster recognition algorithms, the fragment distribution throughout this expansion and the dynamics of the cluster formation. Results: Studying the topology of the equilibrium states, before the expansion, we reproduced the known pasta phases plus a novel phase we called pregnocchi, consisting of proton aggregates embedded in a neutron sea. We have identified different fragmentation regimes, depending on the initial temperature and fragment velocity. In particular, for the already mentioned pregnocchi, a neutron cloud surrounds the clusters during the early stages of the expansion, resulting in systems that give rise to configurations compatibles with the emergence of r-proccess. Conclusions: These calculations pave the way to a comparision between Earth experiments and neutron star studies.},
